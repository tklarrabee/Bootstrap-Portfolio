                    I am a brilliant and handsome software developer named Tyle. I got my start working as an intern at
                Employer's Guardian before being promoted to a full time Salesforce Administrator after successfully
                implementing Conga Composer in Employer's Guardian's org.
                <br>
                Employer's Guardian uses the force.com platform to host a proprietary database custom built by me to
                handle every aspect of the Employer's Guardian service model. My economics background comes in quite
                handy for building company metrics and designing interfaces engineered to empower users to make
                better decisions.
                <br>
                My greatest passion are my lizard children, Joey and Phoebe. They are horned mountaing dragons that I
                bought on an impulse in September of 2018. When I got them I thought they would be a low
                maintenance, scaly pal that would be cheap to house. Having built an enclosure the size of a
                full-sized refrigerator with my own hands, I can safely say that I was sorely mistaken. Regardless I
                love my pets very much and it was deeply rewarding building them the perfect environment.
                <br>
                As I joke I often refer to my lizards as my children because it's really funny to joke that I am
                going to be a spinster lizard keeper. My parents laugh along, but you can see the sligtly pained
                expression in her eyes. To me that's the funniest part.
